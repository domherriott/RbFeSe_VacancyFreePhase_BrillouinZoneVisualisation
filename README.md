# RbFeSe_VacancyFreePhase_BrillouinZoneVisualisation

## Description
This repository contains code to produce to-scale brillouin zone visualisations of the RbFeSe superconductor vacancy free phase, with the Gamma, M, P, T and X points being marked. It is written in `html` and `javascript` and uses the `p5.js` and `WebGL` packages.
 

This visualiser was used to produce figures for the [Imaging the local electronic and magnetic properties of intrinsically phase separated Rb_x Fe_{2â€“y} Se_2 superconductor using scanning microscopy techniques](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6668/aaffa8)
paper that was published in [Superconductor Science and Technology](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0953-2048) in February 2019.
